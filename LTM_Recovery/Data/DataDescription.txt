Each mat file contains data collected under multiple 
lighting conditions, for a single occupancy scenario. 

N is the number of lighting conditions applied, and the 
first lighting condition is the base light. So (N-1) 
perturbation patterns are applied. 

Here all data are collected using ColorBug sensors, which 
are mounted on the walls. 

BaseLight is the base light. 

Each row of TestLight is a lighting condition. And the 
first row is the base light. The other rows are perturbation
patterns added on the base light. 

Each row of cdata contains all sensor readings under the 
corresponding lighting condition. 

mag is the magnitude of the perturbation. 

imgs are four images captured by four cameras. 

t is the lenght of time during which all measurements are
made. 

info contains the information about the measurements. 

The file name is formatted this way:
Class + ID 
Class is the occupancy scenario: 0 means empty room, and 
a letter means the part of the room being occupied. 
  Z  X  V
  Y  W  U
  A = U and V
  B = W and X
  C = Y and Z
ID is a randomly generated number.
