# COSBOS: COlor-Sensor-Based Occupancy Sensing

![logo](resources/logo.png)

## Overview

This is the software package for using color sensors and perturbation-modulated light (color-controllable fixtures required) to estimate the occupancy distribution in an indoor space. It corresponds to these papers:

## Contents

This package includes:

1. The code for Light Transport Model (LTM) recovery, both overdetermined
and underdetermined. See 'LTM_Recovery/demo_LTM.m' for a demo. This work
is described in [2].

2. The code for 3D scene estimation with light blockage model and wall-mounted
sensors. See 'BlockageModel/demo_Blockage.m' for a demo. This work is
described in [1] and [3].

3. The code for floor-plane occupancy mapping with light reflection model
and ceiling-mounted sensors. See 'ReflectionModel/demo_Reflection.m' for
a demo. This work is described in [1].

More information:

* [4] is not directly related to this package. It is about the new color
sensors that we have built for occupancy sensing.

* In each demo, we included example data. But the code for data collection
has too many dependencies: platform, hardware, driver, and other software
packages. Thus we are not including the code for data collection here.
