COSBOS is a high-performance MATLAB/Octave toolbox for occupancy sensing using color sensors. It implements advanced Light Transport Matrix (LTM) recovery techniques and occupancy models, optimized for speed and reliability.

## Project Overview
Color sensors can be used as low-cost, privacy-preserving alternatives to cameras for occupancy sensing. By measuring changes in the Light Transport Matrix (LTM) of a room, we can infer the presence and location of occupants. COSBOS provides the tools to:
1. Recover the LTM from sensor measurements, both overdetermined and underdetermined. This work
is described in [2].
2. Model occupancy using light blockage (for wall-mounted sensors). This work is
described in [1] and [3].
3. Model occupancy using light reflection (for ceiling-mounted sensors). This work is described in [1].

More information:
* [4] is not directly related to this package. It is about the new color
sensors that we have built for occupancy sensing.
* In each demo, we included example data. But the code for data collection
has too many dependencies: platform, hardware, driver, and other software
packages. Thus we are not including the code for data collection here.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/wq2012/COSBOS.git`
2. Ensure you have MATLAB or Octave installed.
3. If using the Blockage Model, you need to compile the C++ MEX files:
   - Go to `BlockageModel/` and run `compile.m` in MATLAB/Octave.
   - Requires a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).

## Key Features
- **High Performance**: Vectorized computations and optimized C++ MEX implementations.
- **Robust Modularity**: Module-specific configuration files (e.g., `coordinates_blockage.m`) to prevent name collisions.
- **Absolute Path Support**: All demos and tests are designed to run from any directory without path issues.
- **Clean Output**: Silenced runtime warnings and polished logs.

## Modules

### LTM Recovery
Located in `LTM_Recovery/`. Solves $Y = AX$ for the mapping $A$.
- `solve_A_fullrank.m`: Standard pseudo-inverse solution.
- `solve_A_Fnorm.m`: Stable low-rank approximation via SVD.
- `solve_A_0norm.m`: Sparse recovery using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP).
- `solve_A_1norm.m`: Sparse recovery using primal-dual interior point methods.

### Blockage Model
Located in `BlockageModel/`. For wall-mounted sensors.
- Uses `coordinates_blockage.m` for spatial configuration.
- `hashGaussians.cpp`: Optimized MEX code for distance hashing (no heap allocation in hot loops).
- `volumeFromHashing.cpp`: Fast volume rendering via optimized internal matrix management.

### Reflection Model
Located in `ReflectionModel/`. For ceiling-mounted sensors.
- Uses `coordinates_reflection.m` for spatial configuration.
- `getReflectionKernel.m`: Fully vectorized implementation for near-instant kernel generation.

## Running Demos
Each module includes a robust demo script:
- `LTM_Recovery/demo_LTM.m`: Demonstrates LTM recovery techniques.
- `BlockageModel/demo_Blockage.m`: Renders a 3D occupancy volume.
- `ReflectionModel/demo_Reflection.m`: Generates a floor-plane occupancy map.

## Unit Testing
Run the master test script from the project root:
```matlab
addpath('tests');
run_tests;
```
This verifies LTM recovery accuracy, MEX script correctness, and model performance.
